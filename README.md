# FOP Project - Golang Interpreter

This project is a GoLang Interpreter implemented using Java. 
It allows users familiar with GoLang to execute GoLang-like commands and expressions via a console interface. 
The actual computations and processing of the input are handled by the Java backend, providing the best experience that connects GoLang syntax with Java's execution engine.

Clone the Repository to get access to all files, packages and classes;
=================================================================================================================================
* Using Command Prompt cd the place where you want to clone Git project, for example : ` cd C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop`
* Secondly, you have to clone Git Repository on your Desktop : `git clone <repository-url>`
* After you have to open an IDE and follow the next steps:
  1) Navigate to the list of your project and click on Open and Choose the location you clone Git Repositry on:

  3) Now you have access to all of the documents uploaded on Git Repository;

**Use an Implementer**
=================================================================================================================================

1)Check for Golang codes that are already created for User to input in IDE console
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Navigate to >FopProject>src>GolangUserInputs;

Here you have access to every code that works perfectly for the given algorithms.

**You have to copy the part of code after:**

You can change the main variable if want to;
For example, here you can change the meaning of n;
2)Open the main class and launch it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Navigate to >FopProject>src>main
 Now you have access to console.

 
3)Paste copied GolangUserInputs code in console

**After pasting the code hit enter and you are all done;**

**The same works for all given GolangUserInput codes**
